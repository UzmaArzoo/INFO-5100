Refugee Aid Management System

The purpose of this project is to provide aid to people who are affected during natural calamities and have no resources with them. These destructed areas have a scarcity of food, medical aid, shelter. It is a humanitarian act to help such mentally and physically affected people. 
For example, the current civil war which is going on since the last 7 years has caused a lot of destruction and its citizens are mainly affected because of this. 


Proposed Solution:
We will be developing an Aid Management System application that will help the affected people to get the resources. The organization employees will participate to take the survey. This survey will include all the incident details like food/water supplies, shelter, medical aid. This surveyed data is then sent to the head office via email. Later this data is segregated based on resources needed for the affected people. Based on resource need, supplier/organizations are contacted to provide the aid accordingly.
This application will be a swing application to simulate how Aid Management System works for destructed countries.
